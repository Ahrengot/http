# HTTP in Elm

Make HTTP requests in Elm.


## Examples

  - GET requests - [demo and code](http://elm-lang.org/examples/http)
  - Download progress - [demo](https://hirafuji.com.br/elm/http-progress-example/) and [code](https://gist.github.com/pablohirafuji/fa373d07c42016756d5bca28962008c4)


## More Resources

You can read more about how HTTP requests work in Elm in [this section of the guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/effects/http.html). Instead of just reading that page, I recommend reading the whole chapter on [The Elm Architecture](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/) so you understand how everything fits together!
